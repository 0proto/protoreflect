// Package dynamic provides an implementation for a dynamic protobuf message.
// In addition to implementing the proto.Message interface, the included
// Message type also provides a Descriptor() method that behaves just like the
// method of the same signature in messages generated by protoc. Because of
// this, it is actually compatible with proto.Message in many (though not all)
// contexts, including the use of proto.Marshal and proto.Unmarshal to
// serialize and de-serialize messages.
//
// This package also contains a type named ExtensionRegistry. This allows the
// parsing of dynamic messages to recognize and parse extension fields. It is
// the dynamic analog of the various extension-related methods in the proto
// package (that allow code to query for known extensions and to get extension
// field values from message objects).
//
// The dynamic Message supports binary and text marshaling, using protobuf's
// well-defined binary format and the same text format that protoc-generated
// types use. It also supports JSON serialization/de-serialization by
// implementing the json.Marshaler and json.Unmarshaler interfaces.
