// Package dynamic provides an implementation for a dynamic protobuf message.
// In addition to implementing the proto.Message interface, the included
// Message type also provides a Descriptor() method that behaves just like the
// method of the same signature in messages generated by protoc. Because of
// this, it is actually compatible with proto.Message in many (though not all)
// contexts, including the use of proto.Marshal and proto.Unmarshal to
// serialize and de-serialize messages.
//
// This package also contains a several registries, for managing known types and
// descriptors. The MessageRegistry is used for interacting with Any messages
// where the actual embedded value may be a dynamic message. The KnownTypeRegistry
// allows de-serialization to use generated message types, instead of dynamic
// messages, for some kinds of nested message fields. And the ExtensionRegistry
// is for recognizing and parsing extensions fields (for proto2 messages).
//
// The dynamic Message supports binary and text marshaling, using protobuf's
// well-defined binary format and the same text format that protoc-generated
// types use. It also supports JSON serialization/de-serialization by
// implementing the json.Marshaler and json.Unmarshaler interfaces.
